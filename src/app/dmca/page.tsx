            <h2 className="text-4xl font-bold">Submission Guidelines for Copyright Complaints</h2>
            <p className="text-xl text-white/60">
            If you are a copyright owner or an authorized agent and believe that material accessible through our Services infringes upon your copyrights, we invite you to submit a written copyright infringement notification (“Notification”). Please use the contact details provided below to submit your Notification, ensuring compliance with all DMCA requirements.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-4xl font-bold">Before Submitting a Complaint</h2>
            <p className="text-xl text-white/60">
            Prior to submitting a copyright complaint, it is advisable to seek legal counsel if you are uncertain about the infringement status of the material in question. The DMCA mandates the inclusion of personal information in the infringement notification, and if privacy concerns arise, consult with legal professionals accordingly.
            </p>
            <h2 className="text-4xl font-bold">Notification Review Process</h2>
            <p className="text-xl text-white/60">
            Upon receiving a valid Notification, we will conduct a thorough review to assess its accuracy, validity, and completeness. If the complaint meets the DMCA requirements, our response may involve the removal or restriction of access to the allegedly infringing material.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl text-white/60">
            In cases where materials are removed or access restricted, we will make a good faith effort to notify the affected user, providing relevant information about the action taken.
            </p>
            
            
            <h2 className="text-4xl font-bold">Operator's Discretion</h2>
            <p className="text-xl text-white/60">
            The Operator reserves the right to take no action if a DMCA copyright infringement notification fails to comply with all DMCA requirements. This policy does not limit our ability to pursue other remedies to address suspected infringement.
            </p>
