              </AccordionTrigger>

                There are two methods to remove the watermarks from your final
                products in Alight Motion Mod. Either you buy the premium version
                and automatically get rid of the watermarks. On the other hand you
                can download the mod version of Alight Motion which will help you
                get rid of all the watermarks.
